I specialize in working with clients who are navigating feelings of anxiety and
depression, low self-esteem, relationship challenges, chronic health conditions,
and healing from trauma. Whether you're seeking relief from symptoms or desire
to enhance your overall well-being, I am here to support you.

Together we will address your challenges in a way that draws on your strengths
and aligns with your values. I will listen compassionately, challenge you
appropriately, teach you skills, and provide you with resources. My counseling
style is holistic, mindfulness-based, trauma-informed, neurodiversity-affirming,
and body-centered.

Choosing to engage in therapy is a big deal and takes courage. I see you putting
in the effort to care for yourself, and I’m glad you’re here. If you think we
might be a good fit, please reach out to schedule a consultation so we can
connect. I am happy to answer any questions you might have and look forward to
meeting you.
